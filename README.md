This is a CLI game built using Ruby. To play please download all files in the repository. Navigate to the directory and type “ruby bin/run.rb”. The game will load and you will be on your way. Are you up to the challenge?

After entering your name the journey begins. The game starts at the scene of the crime. Interview witnesses to get clues about where your suspect might be headed to next. Personal clues about the suspect can be added to your evidence book. As you add clues to the evidence book the list of suspects will shrink. Make sure to act fast as you only have 12 hours before the perp gets away. If you don’t catch the crook before the day is over you will need to make your best guess as to who is guilty.

Each game follows a different path through the city, has different clues, and a different suspect. No two games will be the same.
