CLI PROJECT RETROSPECTIVE

Difficult: triple join table

3 Things Learned

1. Triple join table
2. Sketch out all relationships thoroughly before jumping into coding the classes
3. Pair program the meat of the program so that when we split up tasks and went on our own we both had a good grasp of how everything interacted with each other. Reduced merge conflicts.

Change or Add?

	1. Wish we had more time to refactor. Cli is far too huge. Possibly a Printer class to handle all the menus.
	2. More functionality that we left out such as ranks or loading saved games
